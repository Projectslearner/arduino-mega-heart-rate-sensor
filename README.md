# Heart Rate Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Heart Rate Sensor project demonstrates how to use a heart rate sensor module with an Arduino Mega to measure and display the user's heart rate in beats per minute (BPM). The heart rate sensor module outputs an analog voltage proportional to the heart rate, which is then processed by the Arduino to calculate and display the BPM on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **Heart Rate Sensor Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Heart Rate Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin** of the heart rate sensor to analog pin A0 on Arduino Mega
   - **VCC** of the heart rate sensor to **5V** on Arduino Mega
   - **GND** of the heart rate sensor to **GND** on Arduino Mega

#### Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - No external libraries are required for this project.

2. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the heart rate sensor module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Ensure the heart rate sensor is correctly positioned on the user.
   - Observe the heart rate readings displayed on the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications

- **Health Monitoring:** Monitor and track heart rate during physical activities or at rest.
- **Fitness Devices:** Integrate heart rate monitoring into fitness trackers or wearable devices.
- **Medical Devices:** Use in medical applications for patient monitoring and diagnostics.
- **Biofeedback Systems:** Implement in biofeedback systems for stress management and relaxation techniques.

#### Notes

- Ensure the heart rate sensor is securely attached to obtain accurate readings.
- Adjust the delay time in the `loop()` function to control the frequency of heart rate updates based on your application requirements.
- Calibrate the sensor according to manufacturer guidelines for optimal performance.
- Experiment with different sensor placements and configurations to improve accuracy.
